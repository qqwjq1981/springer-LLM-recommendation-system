£139,544 in Wales; £116,542 in Scotland, and £111,314 in Northern Ireland.The average house price fell marginally to £180,226, from £180,444 in October.\"\\n    '}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_tokens': 5000}}\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,251 - DEBUG - Sending HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,252 - DEBUG - connect_tcp.started host='api.openai.com' port=443 local_address=None timeout=5.0 socket_options=None\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,280 - DEBUG - connect_tcp.complete return_value=<httpcore._backends.sync.SyncStream object at 0x7f7eacdacdc0>\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,281 - DEBUG - start_tls.started ssl_context=<ssl.SSLContext object at 0x7f7eae107ac0> server_hostname='api.openai.com' timeout=5.0\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,288 - DEBUG - start_tls.complete return_value=<httpcore._backends.sync.SyncStream object at 0x7f7eacdafe80>\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,289 - DEBUG - send_request_headers.started request=<Request [b'POST']>\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,290 - DEBUG - send_request_headers.complete\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,290 - DEBUG - send_request_body.started request=<Request [b'POST']>\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,292 - DEBUG - send_request_body.complete\n2025-03-20 03:26:42,292 - DEBUG - receive_response_headers.started request=<Request [b'POST']>\n2025-03-20 03:26:43,719 - DEBUG - receive_response_headers.complete return_value=(b'HTTP/1.1', 200, b'OK', [(b'Date', b'Thu, 20 Mar 2025 03:26:43 GMT'), (b'Content-Type', b'application/json'), (b'Transfer-Encoding', b'chunked'), (b'Connection', b'keep-alive'), (b'access-control-expose-headers', b'X-Request-ID'), (b'openai-organization', b'user-gbgqrr8mnjzeosnimrnxpaf7'), (b'openai-processing-ms', b'744'), (b'openai-version', b'2020-10-01'), (b'x-ratelimit-limit-requests', b'5000'), (b'x-ratelimit-limit-tokens', b'2000000'), (b'x-ratelimit-remaining-requests', b'4999'), (b'x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens', b'1994629'), (b'x-ratelimit-reset-requests', b'12ms'), (b'x-ratelimit-reset-tokens', b'161ms'), (b'x-request-id', b'req_1fe0d8f3a96ed7f2ed73159ba3d5d0f5'), (b'strict-transport-security', b'max-age=31536000;

$768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday.However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.\"\\nArticle 2: \"Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said.The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty.Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami.But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage,\" the ADB report said.A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty.Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources.In its first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage.\"Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,\" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali.Sri Lanka\\'s government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn.Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs.The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries.\"\\n\\nProvide your reasoning and output in strict JSON format:\\n{\\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explain your decision briefly\",\\n  \"answer\": \"Yes\" or \"No\"\\n}'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'max_tokens': 300, 'temperature': 0.2}}\n2025-03-20 04:05:06,432 - DEBUG - Sending HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\n2025-03-20 04:05:08,247 - DEBUG - receive_response_headers.complete return_value=(b'HTTP/1.1', 200, b'OK', [(b'Date', b'Thu, 20 Mar 2025 04:05:08 GMT'), (b'Content-Type', b'application/json'), (b'Transfer-Encoding', b'chunked'), (b'Connection', b'keep-alive'), (b'access-control-expose-headers', b'X-Request-ID'), (b'openai-organization', b'user-gbgqrr8mnjzeosnimrnxpaf7'), (b'openai-processing-ms', b'1668'), (b'openai-version', b'2020-10-01'), (b'x-ratelimit-limit-requests', b'5000'), (b'x-ratelimit-limit-tokens', b'2000000'), (b'x-ratelimit-remaining-requests', b'4999'), (b'x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens', b'1999300'), (b'x-ratelimit-reset-requests', b'12ms'), (b'x-ratelimit-reset-tokens', b'21ms'), (b'x-request-id', b'req_1087e77c2f645f818b16302e6e49f71f'), (b'strict-transport-security', b'max-age=31536000;
