## About the book

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation systems is transforming personalization, enabling deep context awareness and nuanced user understanding beyond traditional methods. As personalization becomes central to engagement and business growth, mastering LLM-driven approaches is essential.

This book covers:
- Fundamentals of LLMs and classic recommender systems  
- Techniques like tokenization, retrieval, fine-tuning, and embedding  
- Advanced topics: conversational recommenders, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal systems  
- Future trends, ethical challenges, and system-level implications  
- Practical, tutorial-driven implementations

Readers will be equipped to design, implement, and evaluate LLM-powered recommendation systems, and adapt the techniques to production use cases.
